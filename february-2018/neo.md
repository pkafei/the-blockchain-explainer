### Value Proposition: 

**Fast Transaction Time**
<br />
Neo can proccess 10,000 transactions per second. For a point of comparison Ethereum does 14 transactions per second, and Bitcoin processes 3 transactions per second. 

**Fork Resistant**
<br />
Neo uses the [Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://www.coinbureau.com/analysis/neo-is-much-more-than-chinese-ethereum/) consensus mechanism (dBFT) which prevents developers from creating a hard fork of the project. This is important because hard forks have created great controversy in the Bitcoin and Ethereum community.


**Quantum Computing Resistant**
<br />
Neo is Quantum computing resistant unlike most other blockchains. Under the hood Neo implements [lattice-based cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography)
