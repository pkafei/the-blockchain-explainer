# Blockchain Explainer Review: Bytecoin
[![](https://www.coinspot.com.au/public/img/coinlg/bytecoin.png?v=68)](https://bytecoin.org/)

Introduction: Bytecoin was created in 2012, and was one of the first privacy coins created. Despite popular belief, Bitcoin is not anonymous and transactions can be traced by third parties. Bytecoin, on the other hand, hides the identity of the sender and the reciever.

### Value Proposition: 

Bytecoin was created as an alternative to Bitcoin. Bytecoin, unlike Bitcoin, is untracable because it uses [ring signatures](https://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/Ring_signature). 

Bytecoin is also unique from Bitcoin because it implements [Cryptonote](https://cryptonote.org/inside/). Cryptonote also obscures transactions and uses egalitarian proof-of-work. In layman's terms, this means that you don't need [ASIC hardware](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ASIC) to mine bytecoin.


### Leadership: 

Doesn't seem like there is a lot of technical leadership. The last commit to master occurred almost [four years ago](https://github.com/amjuarez/bytecoin/graphs/contributors).
