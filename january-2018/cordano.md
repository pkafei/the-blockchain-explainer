![](http://files.coinmarketcap.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/static/img/coins/200x200/cardano.png)

Introduction: Cardano is a blockchain ecosystem that uses proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros. Ada holders (or stakers) are randomly chosen in a lottery and when chosen the Ada holder is given a slot to validate a transaction. More details in video.

### Value Proposition: 

Cardano has set out to create a consensys mechanism that is more energy efficient than Proof of Work(POW).


### Leadership: 

Cardano is the brain child of [IOHK](https://iohk.io/projects/cardano/). Charles Hoskinson is the CEO of IOHK and a Haskell aficionado. He leads a merry army of [functional programming nerds](https://iohk.io/projects/cardano/#team) who spend their days creating Cardano's proof of stake protocol.
